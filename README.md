# JSON body serialization experiments

## Current results:

```console
$ dotnet run -c Release
System.Text.Json client: {"Greeting":"Hi"}
Newtonsoft.Json client: {"greeting":"Hi"}
StringBody via Newtonsoft.Json using System.Text.Json client: {"Greeting":"Hi"}
```

## How to run

Navigate to the echo service directory and start it

```console
EchoService $ dotnet run -c Release
```

Then, you can run the greeter and inspect echo service log output as well as what is returned on the different echo service client calls

```console
Greeter $ dotnet run -c Release
System.Text.Json client: {"Greeting":"Hi"}
Newtonsoft.Json client: {"greeting":"Hi"}
StringBody via Newtonsoft.Json using System.Text.Json client: {"Greeting":"Hi"}
```
